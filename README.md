# MonteCarloSim

The first week of this project was getting familiar to python and numpy library, and making a card game to learn OOP in depth. The second week dived into basic Monte Carlo Simulations where we approximated $\pi$, $e$ and learnt how to calulate area of a complex shape in multiple dimensions. There was also a quant challenge in which we predicted prices of stocks using Geometric Brownian Motion simulation and also compared monte carlo estimates with the Black-Scholes Price estimate.
