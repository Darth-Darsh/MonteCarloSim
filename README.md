\begin{itemize}
\item Designed a \textbf{rule-driven Blackjack simulator} using \textbf{object-oriented state machines}, implementing hand valuation, dealer policies, bust logic, and win–loss resolution with clean game mechanics and terminal visualisation

\item Implemented a \textbf{Monte Carlo reinforcement learning agent} to learn optimal state–action policies from \textbf{episodic interaction}, using return averaging, policy evaluation, and iterative improvement in a \textbf{stochastic environment}

\item Engineered a \textbf{modular game engine architecture} with deck abstraction, dynamic Ace handling, state transitions, and structured reward signals to enable scalable \textbf{RL training, experimentation, }and\textbf{ policy evaluation}
